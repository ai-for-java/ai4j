# AI4J: Supercharge your Java application with the power of AI

Java library for smooth integration with AI tools and services.

## Current capabilities:
- Integration with [OpenAI (ChatGPT)](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction) for:
  - [Chats](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat)
  - [Completions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/completion)
  - [Embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings)
- [Chat History](https://github.com/ai-for-java/ai4j/blob/master/examples/src/main/java/ChatExamples.java) (convenient short-term memory for conversations with AI)
- [Chat Flow](https://github.com/ai-for-java/ai4j/blob/master/examples/src/main/java/ChatExamples.java) (the most simple way to chat with AI, keeping history)
- Integration with [Pinecone](https://docs.pinecone.io/docs/overview) vector database (embeddings)
- Structured outputs
- Prompt templates
- Parsing and loading documents:
  - Text
  - PDF
- Splitting big documents into overlapping chunks
- Tokenizer (tokenize/detokenize, count tokens)

Coming soon:
- Powerful autonomous agents that can use tools:
  - Searching the internet for up-to-date information
  - Scrapping web pages
  - etc
- Long-term memory for chats and agents
- More integrations with different LLM providers
- More integrations with different vector DBs
- Automatic Document summarization
- Loading of multiple Documents from directory
- Loading Documents via HTTP

## Best practices
We highly recommend viewing [this amazing 90-minute tutorial](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/) on prompt engineering best practices, presented by Andrew Ng (DeepLearning.AI) and Isa Fulford (OpenAI).
This course will teach you how to use LLMs efficiently and achieve the best possible results. Good investment of your time!

Here are some best practices for using LLMs:
- Be responsible. Use AI for Good.
- Be specific. The more specific your query, the best results you will get.
- Add [magical "Letâ€™s think step by step" instruction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.11916.pdf) to your prompt.
- Specify steps to achieve the desired goal yourself. This will make the LLM do what you want it to do.
- Provide examples. Sometimes it is best to show LLM a few examples of what you want instead of trying to explain it.
- Ask LLM to provide structured output (JSON, XML, etc). This way you can parse response more easily and distinguish different parts of it.
- Use unusual delimiters, such as \```triple backticks``` and \<<<triple angle brackets\>>> to help the LLM distinguish data or input from instructions.
